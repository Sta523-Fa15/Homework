## Grading Rubric - HW3

* 20 pts total for the assignment

* Assignment should either have a single Rmd file, if there are more scripts needed then they should have a Makefile. It should be straightforward how to run their code and get the correct output. If you can't get their code to run then apply an appropriate penalty (10-20% depending on severity)

* Code should run in less than 2 hrs on saxon

* Task 1 (8 pts) - Geocoding
    * Overall count of geocoded addresses isn't very important unless it is too large (>2 million) or too small (< 100,000).
    * Approach is more important, check for methods and overall quality - don't have to use both pluto and intersection data but feel free to reward those who did.
    * Check for appropriate merges - are they creating duplicates?
    * Check write-up details approach

* Task 2 (8 pts) - Borough Boundary Prediction
    * Overall approach is the most important thing
    * Check modeling approach 
        - how did they deal with the issue of ocean / river areas?
        - did they go above and beyond the code provided in class?
        - how did they handle the scale of the data? Did they model everything or a subset?
    * Check write-up details approach


* Task 3 (4 pts) - Visualization
    * Visualization should be something interesting
    * Check the code and implementation - usual code quality criteria apply

* Feedback should include suggestions on how to improve the code / writeup (opened as issues on github).
